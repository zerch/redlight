/*
 * -Try rewriting the loops so they start at the end of the arrays and go to the 
 * beginning. This is harder than it looks.
 * -Rewrite all the array usage in this program so that it's pointers.
 * -Rewrite all the pointer usage so they're arrays.
 * -Go back to some of the other programs that use arrays and try to use pointers
 * instead.
 * -Process command line arguments using just pointers similar to how you did 
 * names in this one.
 * -Play with combinations of getting the value of and the address of things.
 * -Add another for-loop at the end that prints out the addresses these pointers
 * are using. You'll need the %p format for printf.
 * -Rewrite this program to use a function for each of the ways you're printing 
 * out things. Try to pass pointers to these functions so they work on the data.
 * -Remember you can declare a function to accept a pointer, but just use it like 
 * an array.
 * -Change the for-loops to while-loops and see what works better for which kind 
 * of pointer usage.
